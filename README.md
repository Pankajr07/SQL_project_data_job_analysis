# Project Overview
This project dives into the remote Data Analyst job market, uncovering:

üí∞ Top-paying roles

üî• Most in-demand skills

üìà The sweet spot where high demand meets high salary

Using SQL, I queried a job postings database to identify the most valuable skills and opportunities in the field of data analytics.

SQL queries can be found in the project_sql folder.

# Project Motivation
Driven by a quest to navigate the data analyst job market more effectively, this project was born from a desire to pinpoint top-paid and in-demand skills, streamlining others work to find optimal jobs.


### The questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:

1.What are the top-paying Data Analyst jobs?

2.What skills are required for these high-salary roles?

3.What are the most in-demand skills in the market?

4.Which skills correlate with higher salaries?

5.What are the most optimal skills (high demand + high salary)?
# üß∞ Tools Used
SQL (PostgreSQL): For writing and running queries

Visual Studio Code: For coding and DB exploration

Git & GitHub: For version control and sharing my work

* For aspiring data analysts, focusing on in-demand AND high-paying skills is key to career growth.


###üí≠ Closing Thoughts
Working on this project has been a really rewarding experience. As a student still learning the ropes of data analysis, diving into real job market data helped me connect what I‚Äôve learned in class to the real world.

I didn‚Äôt just improve my SQL skills‚ÄîI also got a much clearer picture of what companies are actually looking for. Now I know which tools and technologies are not only in high demand, but also lead to better-paying opportunities.

One of my biggest takeaways is that learning SQL is just the beginning. There‚Äôs so much value in understanding how different skills impact your career path. This project helped me see how I can use data to make smarter choices about what to learn next and how to stand out in a competitive job market.

I'm excited to keep growing and to keep using data‚Äînot just to solve problems, but to shape my own career journey, too.
