# Project Motivation
Driven by a quest to navigate the data analyst job market more effectively, this project was born from a desire to pinpoint top-paid and in-demand skills, streamlining others' work to find optimal jobs.



### The questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:

1. What are the top-paying Data Analyst jobs?

2. What skills are required for these high-salary roles?

3. What are the most in-demand skills in the market?

4. Which skills correlate with higher salaries?

5. What are the most optimal skills (high demand + high salary)?
6. 

# üß∞ Tools Used

SQL (PostgreSQL): For writing and running queries

üí≠ Closing Thoughts


Working on this project has been a really rewarding experience. As a student still learning the ropes of data analysis, diving into real job market data helped me connect what I‚Äôve learned in class to the real world.

I didn‚Äôt just improve my SQL skills‚ÄîI also got a much clearer picture of what companies are looking for. Now I know which tools and technologies are not only in high demand but also lead to better-paying opportunities.

One of my biggest takeaways is that learning SQL is just the beginning. There‚Äôs so much value in understanding how different skills impact your career path. This project helped me understand how to utilise data to make informed decisions about what to learn next and how to differentiate myself in a competitive job market.

I'm excited to continue growing and using data, not just to solve problems, but also to shape my own career journey.
